- click an object on right panel to draw with it
- rotate with q and e
- q/e also lets you access other versions of tiles
- want camera bounds to be close to 16:9 ratio, game will make up difference

- mandatory for any level: camera bounds, floor to stand on, debug spawn, save point

- Right click removes tiles

- new shaders go in shaders and shaders_ogl2 (make 2 versions for both folders?)
